                <h2 style="margin-bottom:30px;">Cupping Therapy</h2>


                <p>Cupping therapy is an ancient form of alternative medicine in which a therapist puts special cups on your skin for a few minutes to create suction. People get it for many purposes, including to help with pain, inflammation, blood flow, relaxation and well-being, and as a type of deep-tissue massage. Cupping therapy is a form of traditional medicine that originated in China and West Asia. People have practiced this method for thousands of years. Cups may be made of: Glass, Bamboo, Earthenware, Ceramic, Metal and Silicone. Cupping therapy is usually found as a treatment offered by practitioners of Traditional Chinese Medicine.</p>

<p>There are different ways to do cupping. The steps vary slightly depending on the chosen method. Your provider will leave the cups in place for several minutes. Some treatments involve briefly moving the cups to stretch and massage the area.
Cupping methods include:
<ol>
<li>Dry: Your provider heats the inside of each cup. The traditional method involves setting an alcohol-soaked cotton ball aflame. The heat sends oxygen out of the cup, creating a vacuum. A more modern approach involves using a suction device to remove air from the cups. The vacuum force pulls your skin up into the cup.</li>
<li>Running: This is like dry cupping. But before beginning, your provider will apply lotion or oil to your skin. Once they place the cups, they’ll gently move them in different directions over the affected area of your body.</li>
<li>Bleeding: Your provider uses a needle to lightly puncture your skin before placing the cups. This allows for the release of toxins through the suctioned blood captured in the cup.</li>
</ol>
</p>

<p>Cupping is sometimes performed with acupuncture treatments. For best results, you may also want to fast or eat only light meals 2 to 3 hours before your cupping session.
During a cupping treatment, you can expect the following:
<ol>
<li>Your practitioner will ask you what symptoms you’ve been experiencing, likely taking a detailed health history if this is your first time visiting them.</li>
<li>The practitioner will place cups on your skin.</li>
<li>You’ll feel a sucking sensation and pressure as the cups are suctioned.</li>
<li>The practitioner may use heat or suction alone to place the cups.</li>
<li>Depending on the type of cupping, the practitioner may leave you to rest for a few minutes before they return to remove the cups.</li>
<li>Your skin may turn red and show light bruising after your session.</li>
</ol>
